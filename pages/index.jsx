            It is Spring, 1698.
            You are a small-time coureur-des-bois plying the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes in search of a fast buck.
            It's miserable business but somebody has to do it.
            Besides, there's a fortune to be made.

            Luckily you are of a hardy constitution and you are more than willing to do what it takes to get deals done.
            You have no qualms about buying and selling questionable goods to the highest bidder.

            You've got one year to prove your worth. Everyone is eager to see how you will do.
